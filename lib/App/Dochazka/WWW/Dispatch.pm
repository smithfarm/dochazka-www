=head1 NAME

App::MFILE::WWW::Dispatch - app dispatch stub



=head1 SYNOPSIS

TBD



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is where we override the default version of the is_authorized method
defined by L<Web::Machine::Resource>.

This module is only used in standalone mode. In derived distribution mode, the
application's dispatch module will be used, instead.

=head1 METHODS


=head2 process_post

POST requests are assumed to be AJAX calls. Their entity bodies must be valid
JSON with the following simple structure:

    { method: HTTP_METHOD, path: RESOURCE, body: BODY_JSON }

where HTTP_METHOD is any HTTP method accepted by the REST server, RESOURCE is a
valid path to a REST server resource, and BODY_JSON is the content body to be
sent in the HTTP request to the REST server. Provided the request is properly
authorized and the body is well-formed, the request is forwarded to the REST
server via the L<App::MFILE> package's C<rest_req> routine and the REST
server's response is sent back to the user's browser, where it is processed by
the JavaScript code.

In derived-distro mode, this structure is expected to be translated into a
"real" HTTP request, to be forwarded via the LWP::UserAgent object stored in
the session data. The status object received in the response is then passed
back to the JavaScript side.

There is one special case: the POST request from the login dialog looks like this:

    { method: "LOGIN", path: "login", body: { nam: "foo", pwd: "bar" } }

Login requests receive special handling.
